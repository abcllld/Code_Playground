// Why Functions?
// You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
// You can use the same code many times with different arguments,
// to produce different results.


// OR


// A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere
// in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code
// again and again.
// DRY => do not repeat yourself
