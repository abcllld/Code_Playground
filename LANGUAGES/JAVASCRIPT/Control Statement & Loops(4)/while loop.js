// While Loop Statement
// The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement 
// as long as the test condition evaluates to true.


var num = 0;
while(num <=10);{
console.log(num); //If here left only then it will be infinite loop
num++;
}

// The code written within {} are called block scope. The block scope is valid only when the condition evaluates to true. For e.g,
// var num = 20;
// while(num <=10);{
// console.log(num); //If here left only then it will be infinite loop
// num++;
// }

// this is wrong condition as 20 is not less than or equal to 10. so block scope has No use Here
