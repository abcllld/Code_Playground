// WILL THIS CODE RUN



// #include<stdio.h>
// int main(){
// int x = 2;

// int(x=1){
// printf("x is equal to 1\n");
// }
// else{
//     printf("x is not equal to 1")
// }
// return 0;

// }

// (A)--------------------------->>>>>>>>> THE CODE HAS ERROR
// (B)--------------------------->>>>>>>>>  X IS EQUAL TO 1
// (C)--------------------------->>>>>>>>>  X IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 

// Here(B)------>>> is correct

// int has first value 2.. but it overwritten by 1 AND AS 1(or any non-zero) NUMBER IS TRUE IN C........ so it will print the statements
// If there would have been 0 in place of 1 then it would have printed(C)

//Although a warning will be given as we have used here = and not== ... but it is not error ... it is just a warning
